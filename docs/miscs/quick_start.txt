After a git clone, run the following:

mkdir backend/DB/website
echo "SECRET_KEY=')3q4$!*n-ulu#40ng)v7aa+0ql567mxldz3+vz&l+6z66vgu4#'
DEBUG=True" > backend/.env
docker compose up --build
docker exec -ti backend bash
conda activate backend
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


To access the backend directly, without going through the front, go to:
localhost:8000

To access the backend admin panel, go to:
localhost:8000/api/admin

python manage.py flush -> flush the DB, delete users etc.
python manage.py makemigrations BackendAPI -> prepare the translators between the models and the DB
python manage.py migrate -> prepare the DB so that it can accomodate the models (enable to have changing models and backcompatibility)
python manage.py runserver -> launches the Backend
python manage.py createsuperuser -> creates a super user
